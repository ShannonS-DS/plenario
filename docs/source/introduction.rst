Mission
^^^^^^^

Plenario is a centralized hub for open datasets from around the world. It is designed to take us from "spreadsheets on the web" to truly smart open data. This rests on two fundamental breakthroughs:

1)  Allow users to assemble and download data from multiple, independent data sources, such as two different municipal data portals, or the federal government and a privately curated dataset.

2)  Unite all datasets along a single spatial and temporal index, making it possible to do complex aggregations with one query.

With these advances, Plenario allows users to study regions over specified time periods using all relevant data, regardless of original source, and represent the data as a single time series. By providing a single, centralized hub for open data, the Plenario platform enables urban scientists to ask the right questions with as few constraints as possible.

Automatic Dataset Importation
*****************************

Plenario is more than just a tool or a website: it provides an infrastructure for working with open data. At its heart is an automated ETL builder to extract data from other sources, run custom transformations (to clean and standardize the data, and to align its field definitions with those of similar datasets), and load it into the database. Users can thus expand the universe of accessible data by importing open datasets from a variety of sources—such as data portals that run using Socrata or CKAN, or datasets assembled by independent academics and organizations. Plenario then makes the datasets available to all users of the platform for download and analysis.
